# Advent of Code - My Zig Solutions

This is where I'm solving Advent of Code 2025 puzzles using Zig. I'm learning Zig while working through the challenges.

## What's Here

- `2025/dayX-p1.zig`    - Day X part 1 solution
- `2025/dayX-p2.zig`    - Day X part 2 solution
- `2025/input/dayX.txt` - Day X's puzzle input files

`X` meams 1, 2, 3...

## Zig Version

`zig 0.15.2`

## How to Run

```bash
cd 2025
zig run day1-p1.zig
```

Each file is standalone - no build system needed.
